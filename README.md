### COLRv1 & Custom Color Palettes
A distinctive feature of this portfolio is the incorporation of COLRv1 fonts, that create a visually rich and captivating typographical experience. Unlike traditional fonts, COLRv1 allows for smooth gradients, sharp highlights, and blended shadows. As a result, COLRv1 fonts help to transform text from simple means of communication, into an integral part of the design narrative. The project features two hand-picked color palettes designed specifically for light and dark modes.
